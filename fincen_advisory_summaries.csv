Pay attention to transactions for high-value items like electronics, auto parts, or precious metals. Scrutinize third-party payments by unrelated intermediaries and accounts showing activity across multiple financial institutions consistent with money laundering typologies.","This advisory is crucial for USAA as it highlights the evolving methods of money launderers, who shift to Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML) due to increased diligence in other areas. For a large retail FI, this means customers could unknowingly or knowingly be conduits for TBML, particularly through international wire transfers, third-party payments, or smaller commercial accounts linked to global trade. USAA should enhance investigator training on TBML red flags, strengthen monitoring of international payments (especially to/from high-risk regions mentioned), and ensure risk assessments incorporate the potential for customers to be involved in global trade or to move funds tied to TBML networks, even if the institution does not specialize in trade finance."

The specified fraud type—in-person identity theft using counterfeit U.S. passport cards to access victim accounts—directly impacts frontline operations and customer security. USAA should prioritize immediate training for branch staff on recognizing these specific counterfeit documents and associated behavioral red flags. Furthermore, fraud strategy leaders should review and update identity verification protocols, enhance monitoring rules for in-person transactions and account access attempts, and ensure investigators are aware of the SAR filing requirements, including specific keywords, to effectively combat this prevalent and costly fraud scheme."

These schemes, often perpetrated through banks and check cashers, involve networks of individuals, shell companies, and fraudulent documents, costing state and federal authorities hundreds of millions annually.

While not primarily a commercial bank, USAA serves a broad customer base that likely includes individuals and small businesses involved in construction. This means monitoring for suspicious transactions related to construction companies, especially those involving shell companies, unusual payroll tax activity, or workers' compensation payments, should be prioritized. Investigators need training on these specific typologies, including the use of fraudulent documents and networks of individuals, to enhance detection and reporting of payroll tax evasion and workers' compensation fraud, aligning with FinCEN's request."

It mitigates concerns about supervisory criticism for pilot program failures or the discovery of previously unaddressed gaps, thereby fostering a 'safe space' for experimentation. For fraud strategy leaders, it justifies investment in advanced analytics and new systems to bolster defenses against money laundering and terrorist financing. For AML investigators and FIU analysts, it signals an expectation of evolving tools and the need for training to leverage new technological outputs, potentially leading to the detection of more sophisticated illicit financial activity previously missed."
