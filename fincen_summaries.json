It highlights the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) determination that Iran's inadequate AML/CFT regime presents a significant vulnerability to the international financial system. The advisory also emphasizes compliance with UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR 1737 and 1747), which impose prohibitions on financial and technical assistance related to Iran's proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities. Financial institutions are advised to consider all customers and transactions associated with Iran as a primary risk.",
